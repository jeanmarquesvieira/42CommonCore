# 42 Common Core

This repo contains a version of my 42 Common Core projects as I successfully complete each one of them.

libft: the very first project at 42, which aims to create a library in C, implementing standard C functions from scratch, as well as creating and manipulating linked lists.

ft_printf: this project's goal is to recode the printf in C handling variadic arguments and only using the write function for printing data.

get_next_line: in this project, the idea is to read either from a file or from STDIN, returning the line read as son as a line break is found, using a static variable. On successive calls to the function, it'll return each line that was found, including the line break, up to EOF.

Born2beroot: this project is focused on working with a Virtual Machine and being in charge of System Admin related tasks, such as setting password policies, managing sudo and root access, mounting partitions, creating a shell script with information about the system and so on.
